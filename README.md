# pig-game-js
Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. Made this little game to practice more JavaScript. Starting to feel a little bit confident about JS now. Added some extra functionalities like Settings, player's names, etc. It works on mobile too.
